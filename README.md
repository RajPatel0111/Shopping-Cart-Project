# Shopping-Cart-Project
This is a shopping cart project in java. In this there are 2 items called book and gift card. we have to create functionality that add the items(whether book or gift card) from the user and show the updated shopping cart to user. Moreover this item should be sorted in ascending order of price. And due to limited stock if user want to add the same item again then it shouldn't add into the cart.
